## Problem Research üìö

We conducted extensive research and found that students often struggle to find relevant practice questions, leading to a lack of practice, while teachers face challenges in creating personalized content. Students tend to rely on summary videos for exam preparation, which may not sufficiently cover the material. To address these issues, we propose a solution that offers quick summarization, interactive quizzes, and personalized content generation based on educational videos.


## Problem Statement üéØ

- Watching lengthy lecture videos is time-consuming and tedious.
- Students struggle to find relevant questions for practice.
- Teachers spend considerable time creating quizzes and notes manually.
- Limited access to personalized content affects students' exam preparation.
